        <p className="">
          Projects are more than just tasksâ€”they are proof of expertise,
          innovation, and real-world problem-solving skills. Each project
          represents hands-on experience, creativity, and the ability to turn
          concepts into tangible results. They showcase my journey in tackling
          challenges, learning new technologies, and delivering results that
          make an impact. Through my projects, I aim to demonstrate my ability
          to create efficient, scalable, and user-centric solutions. They are a
          testament to my commitment to growth and continuous learning in a
          fast-evolving industry.
