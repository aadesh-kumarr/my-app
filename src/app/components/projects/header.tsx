        <p className="">Projects are more than just tasksâ€”they are proof of expertise, innovation, and real-world problem-solving skills. Each project represents hands-on experience, creativity, and the ability to turn concepts into tangible results. They showcase my journey in tackling challenges, learning new technologies, and delivering results that make an impact. Through my projects, I aim to demonstrate my ability to create efficient, scalable, and user-centric solutions. They are a testament to my commitment to growth and continuous learning in a fast-evolving industry.</p>
